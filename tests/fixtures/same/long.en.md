Hello,

Welcome to KeepSafe! You just activated your personal KeepSafe account successfully. KeepSafe is the best place to store all your personal and important photos and videos. We make sure that no one gets to see your important photos by accident.

Some ideas for what you could use KeepSafe for as well:

* Keep important pictures of people who are close to you
* Store a photo of your drivers license and other important cards you carry with you
* Separate work and life
* Keep your pictures of surprises and gifts for others

KeepSafe will store all your pictures securely and make sure that only you can access them and that they are not uploaded by accident to services where you donâ€™t want to have them.

KeepSafe also allows you to view your pictures on multiple devices, like a tablet, at the same time.
